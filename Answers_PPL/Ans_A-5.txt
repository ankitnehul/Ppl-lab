1)Do you notice that each usage of local variable as an operand uses a
suffix that can be tracked to it's assignment? Why do some variables
have a suffix `(D)'?

ANS.	Local variables are  suffixed with a unique  number which represents
        the assignment. For  example, `d_3' refers to the  usage of variable
        `d'  and  the  only  assignment  which reaches  this  point  is  the
        assignment `d_3'. 
	Variables that are  likely to be used  before any
        assignment are suffixed  with `(D)' to indicate  that the assignment
        was implicit in the declaration.  This happens to both uninitialized
        local variables and formal parameters.  For example, variable `c' is
        used as `c_4(D)' in the `if' condition.

2)Find the point in the CFG in  which the paths of the two assignments
to variable `a'  and `b' merge. You will notice  that PHI statements
have  been  introduced.  Can  you   guess  the  syntax  of  the  PHI
statements?

ANS.	# a_1 = PHI <a_7(3), a_5(4)>
	This is the syntax of the new PHI statements.
