1)How have if-blocks  been translated into GIMPLE  statements? Can you
differentiate between conditional and unconditional gotos?

ANS.	The if-blocks are translated by breaking down into certain labels (like the temporary variables).
	
2)Repeat  the  above compilation,  but  now  asking for  another  dump
that  of  the pass  "cfg".  View  this  pass  and say  whether  this
representation makes it easier to  read and understand GIMPLEs. Draw
the control-flow graph  of the program A-2.c on a  piece of paper by
looking at the CFG dump.

ANS.	Yes, this representation makes it easier to read and understand GIMPLEs.
	CFG of A-2.c :
	f ()
                {
                  int c;
                  int b;
                  int a;
                  int Z.0;
                  int D.1715;

                <bb 2>:
                  a = Z;
                  if (a <= 9)
                    goto <bb 3>;
                  else
                    goto <bb 4>;

                <bb 3>:
                  b = 5;
                  c = 17;
                  goto <bb 6>;

                <bb 4>:
                  b = 6;
                  c = 20;
                  if (a == 0)
                    goto <bb 5>;
                  else
                    goto <bb 6>;

                <bb 5>:
                  c = 0;

                <bb 6>:
                  D.1715 = b * 10;
                  Z.0 = D.1715 + c;
                  Z = Z.0;
                  return;

                }
