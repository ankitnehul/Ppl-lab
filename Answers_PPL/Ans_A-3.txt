1)Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is
the GIMPLE for a while loop different from simple if-else jumps?

ANS.	Basic blocks 2,  3 and 4 correspond to the  while-loop. A while loop
        is  nothing but  a  set  of basic  blocks  with conditional  control
        transfer.
	The only  notable difference being a jump to  a block that
        has been previously executed.

2)Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be
able  to identify  intializers, conditions  and increments  for each
loop as  well as  the shared  inner body.  Is there  really anything
special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?

ANS.	A  for-loop  is  nothing  but  a  while-loop  with  the  initializer
        separated out  into an  initial basic  block, the  body of  the loop
        subsequently, the  increment part at the  end of the loop  body, and
        the conditional jump back to the start of the loop.
