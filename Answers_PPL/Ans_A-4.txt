1)How is array declaration and initialization handled?

ANS.	Array is initialized same as the variables are initialized.
	The initialization is split into  multiple statements that assign values
        to  individual array  elements.
	
2)Why does the statement a[i] = b[i] get broken down to two steps with
an intermediate temporary?

ANS.	 As GIMPLE  can perform only  one operation per statement,  
         It cannot read  and write  to  array  locations at  the  same  time.
	 Thus,  these are  split into separate read and write statements
	 by introducing a temporary.

3)Why are there CLOBBER statements at the end?

ANS.	CLOBBER statements are used for  address-escaped variables. It is an
        annotation  to  signify  that  the  scope  of  this  address-escaped
        variable has ended.
