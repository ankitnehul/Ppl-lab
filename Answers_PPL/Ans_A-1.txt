1)How  do the  declarations  look in  the  GIMPLE? Specifically,  what happens to multiple  variables declared and 
initialized  on the same line? What happens to global declaration [int Z]?

ANS.	 Each  declaration is  displayed on  its own  line as  an independent
         local variable  declaration . For multiple variable they are declared
	 first and then the respective value is assigned.
	 There is no  declaration for global  variables; they
         are used directly.
	
2)How are complex  expressions such as [c  = a * b +  25] broken down?
Can you  determine a  rule as  to when  temporary variables  will be
introduced?

ANS.    Any expression containing  more than  one  operation is  broken  up by  introducing
        temporary variable. Firsly temporary variable _1 is created and a * b is assigned into it
	after that in next step 25 is added into _1 and their addition is assigned to the variable c.
	
3)How are  floats/doubles represented in  GIMPLE? What happens  when a
float/double is assigned to an integer in [Z = r]?

ANS.	Floats/doubles  are  displayed  in   scientific  notation like which is used in      	calculator.
	First a temporary variable _2 is created and the integer value of r is stored in _2.
	On next step the value of _2 is assigned to Z.
