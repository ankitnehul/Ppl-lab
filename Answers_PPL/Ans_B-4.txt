1)How many  times is the expression  (a + c) computed  in the original
code (as seen in the SSA pass)? What about after the FRE pass?

ANS.	The original code showed two computations, but the FRE pass was able
        to  reuse the  temporary variable  which  stored the  result of  the
        intitial computation  of (a +  c).

2) Why did  we have  to put a  "return b" in  this assignment?  What if
"return b" is changed to "return 0"? Will it make any difference?

ANS.	"return  b" was  required to  make the  computation of  variable `b'
         meaningful. If function  `main' is going to "return 0"  and there is
         no other  output, GCC  will realise that  the entire  computation of
         variable `b' was  dead code and will eliminate  its dependencies one
         by one until the resulting program reduces to:
        
                int main()
                {
                    return 0;
                }
