1)In the file B-3.c, what values  can variable `a' take? Will the `if'
condition [a  < 4] ever  be true?  Inspect the file  B-3.c.*.vrp1 to
analyze the dump.

ANS.	Variable `a' can take the values  4 to 99. Since, the `if' condition
        will never be  true for the give loop  bounds, [b = b +  2] is never
        executed. Therefore, the optimized  code has eliminated this program
        statement.
